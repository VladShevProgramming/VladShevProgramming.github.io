		<h2 id="overview-of-gameplay">Overview of Gameplay</h2>
			<p>The game is an 'arena' game - the player tries to survive as long as they can against infinite
			waves of enemies. The game is heavily beta in that there is no menu screen or tutorial whatsoever.
			The controls are WASD and mouse.</p>
			<p>There are 2 versions in the Downloads section - the normal and the 'troll' version. In the 'troll'
			version, the amount of enemies, the player fire rate and the player health are multiplied by 10.</p>
