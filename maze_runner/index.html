			<p>The information below may only be applicable to the latest version.</p>
			<h3>About</h3>
				<p>MazeRunner, unlike what most people think, had nothing to do with the series that has the same name - 
				it is called what it is beacuse you run through mazes.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>The goal of the game is to get as much score as possible before the time runs out. Getting killed by 
				and enemy will reduce that time and winning a level will give you extra time and score (see below for 
				details.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>Note: The mazes are randomly generated and are always solvable - however, it well may happen that you 
				spawn right beside an enemy or the exit.</p>

				<p>the statistics above mean:</p>
				<div id="ul-list4">
					<p>Number of enemies: the nimber of enemies that spawn every level.</p>
					<p>Points per Level: the amount that is added to the score after beating a level.</p>
					<p>Initial Time: the amount of time (in seconds) that the player starts out with.</p>
					<p>Reward Time: the amount of time (in seconds) that the player gains every time they beat a level.</p>
					<p>Penalty Time: the amount of time (in seconds) that the player loses every time they lose a level.</p>
					<p>Game Speed: how fast the game runs. Ex: at game speed of 2x the game will run twice as fast as when it is a 1x. As the 1x is synced with real time, in nightmare mode the player only starts out with 15 real seconds; however, everything moves twice as fast.</p>
